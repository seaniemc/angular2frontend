# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.6.
The application was further developed, to created a photo displaying website where members can display images and like, dislike photos shared by other members. 

When making this application I followed a tutorial from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/build-a-web-app-with-spring-boot-and-angular-2/learn/v4/overview)

### What is needed to run the full application

This web app is the front end of a full stack application. The corresponding back-end code can be found at the ***[springBootBackend](https://github.com/seaniemc/springBootBackend)*** repo on my profile. 

### Run front-end server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
